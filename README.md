# Loom Whitepaper

Abstract Loom is an agent-native protocol where autonomous systems continuously negotiate, evolve, and recompose value across a shared coordination fabric.
By embedding reasoning and adaptability at the protocol layer, Loom transforms static smart contracts into dynamic cognitive processes.

# Background and Motivation

Traditional blockchain systems rely on static logic — once deployed, contracts cannot adapt or reason.
Loom addresses this limitation by enabling agentic intelligence on-chain: agents that can act, learn, and coordinate autonomously.

# Core Architecture
Reasoning Layer

Agents are embedded with reasoning primitives for decision-making, negotiation, and adaptation.

Negotiation Layer

Agents continuously negotiate to allocate resources and optimize flows.

Recomposition Fabric

Represents the dynamic structure of value and logic across agents.

Persistence and Memory

Enables long-term learning and self-organizing intelligence.

# Network Design
Autonomous Agents operate independently yet cooperatively.
Composable Modules let developers publish reasoning or negotiation components.
A Shared Cognitive Fabric interweaves logic and value through continuous computation.
Adaptation Cycle

observe → reason → negotiate → evolve

# Incentive Design

Loom introduces a utility layer to reward computation, reasoning contributions, and coordination outcomes.

Category	Allocation	Description
Community & Ecosystem	50%	Builder rewards, agent incentives, governance, liquidity programs
Network Incentives	20%	Long-term rewards for active agents and developers
Development & Research	15%	Core team, protocol upgrades, and R&D
Treasury & Reserves	10%	Network stability and strategic growth
Initial Liquidity & Partners	5%	Early partnerships and stability pools
 # Governance

Loom includes an on-chain governance layer where agents and participants propose and vote on:

Protocol evolution
Reward structures
System upgrades
# Security and Verification
Agent interactions are sandboxed to prevent malicious recursion and ensure deterministic outcomes.
Reasoning modules undergo formal verification before deployment.
# Roadmap
Phase	Description
Phase 1	Core architecture and simulation environment
Phase 2	Agent reasoning SDK and negotiation primitives
Phase 3	On-chain coordination fabric deployment
Phase 4	Open agent marketplace and composable intelligence modules

# Loom Protocol Overview
What Is Loom?

Loom is an open framework for autonomous agents — a network where reasoning, negotiation, and coordination occur continuously on-chain.
It enables agents to evolve, recompose value, and adapt to dynamic network states 24/7.

Loom introduces a new paradigm for Web3 infrastructure:

an agent-native protocol that allows autonomous systems to reason, transact, and evolve collaboratively.

 Key Features
 Agent-Native Design: Self-governing agents capable of real-time reasoning and negotiation.
 Composable Intelligence: Developers can deploy new logic modules; when agents adopt them, value flows accordingly.
 Continuous Evolution: Agents learn and adapt from shared network state, creating emergent coordination.
 Open Framework: Build, test, and connect reasoning primitives to an on-chain cognitive fabric.

Layer	Function
Reasoning Layer	Enables cognitive operations, decision-making, and adaptation
Negotiation Layer	Coordinates incentive-aligned exchanges of value and logic
Recomposition Fabric	Dynamically redistributes value and intelligence
Persistence Layer	Maintains agent memory and state continuity
